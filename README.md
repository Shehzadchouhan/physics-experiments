## 🧠 About the Project

This project showcases multiple physics experiments written in:

- 📌 **C++** – Command-line based experiment simulations/calculations.
- 🌐 **Web** – A visual and interactive interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Useful for students, teachers, and anyone trying to understand physics through practical coding examples.

## 🚀 How to Use

### ▶️ For C++ (`cpp/`)

1. Navigate to the `cpp` folder.
2. Compile any `.cpp` file using:
   ```bash
   g++ filename.cpp -o output
   ./output
   

For Web (web/)
Open index.html inside each experiment folder using any browser.

You can also host it using GitHub Pages for easy online preview.
